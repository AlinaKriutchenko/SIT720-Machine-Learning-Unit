# SIT720 Machine Learning Unit
Programming language: Python

Machine learning is an important tool in analytics, where algorithms iteratively learn from data to uncover hidden insights, without being directly programmed on where to find such information. SIT720 will allow students to explore machine-learning techniques such as data representation, unsupervised learning (clustering and factor analysis) methods, supervised learning (linear and non-linear classification) methods, concepts of suitable model complexity for the problem and data at hand. 
Students will have the opportunity to apply these techniques in solving real-world problem scenarios presented to them in the unit.
